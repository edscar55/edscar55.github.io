								I like to think that we wouldn't be here today if it weren't for
								me. Back in February of 2020 - February 7th to be exact - I was
								at Walla Walla University for the Choir and Orchestra Festival,
								and had stopped at the cafeteria for lunch. Out of the blue, I
								saw Edson walking across the cafeteria, which was totally and
								completely random. I hadn't seen him since I moved from Texas in
								2014, so that plus the fact that seeing your childhood crush
								always has a little adrenaline associated with it, meant that I
								was completely thrown. So, to avoid coming across as a total
								fool and since he probably wouldn't recognize 18-year-old me, I
								decided to deploy my parents, whom he would definitely recognize
								and who would actually remember his name. Once I had decided
								that they had conversed for an appropriate amount of time, I
								went over to say hi, which resulted in a somewhat awkward hug.
								It wasn't too terrible of an interaction though, so I dm'ed him
								a couple weeks later on Instagram. My excuse was that I wanted
								to catch up with a friend from my old church in Texas, but I'm
								pretty sure my subconscious was just trying to get him to notice
								me. We talked about how lovely the mangoes are from the Valley,
								and then The Princess Bride. And then we just didn't stop
								talking.
							</p>
							<p align="left">
								The COVID-19 pandemic definitely played into our near constant
								conversations. I got stuck at home in mid-March, so I had way
								too much time on my hands, and Edson stayed at Walla Walla
								during spring quarter but most of his friends had left, so he
								also needed someone to talk to. We were really just good friends
								at this point: I didn't think I had any feelings for him, and
								besides, we were living very different lives anyway.
								Fast-forward to mid-June, however, and it seems like we might
								actually have feelings for each other. Since I was going to work
								for my grandparents in Tri-Cities for a week and he was still in
								Walla Walla, I suggested that we get together while I was in
								town, which was going to be the first time we had seen each
								other since February. He agreed, and we made plans for
								Wednesday, June 24th, to have a picnic up on the hill with the
								windmills just off Wallula Junction. The night before, while we
								were talking on the phone, was the first time he told me he
								loved me, but I refused to say it back since we hadn't even seen
								each other in four months, and I wanted to be sure that I
								actually wanted to commit myself to this person. Turns out, I
								did, since about two hours into our picnic the next day we were
								so comfortable around each other that it felt like we had known
								each other forever, prompting me to ask him, "So...can we just
								be dating?" I probably couldn't ask for a better first date.
							</p>
							<p align="left">
								Unfortunately, we immediately started out as a long distance
								couple, since he was living in Walla Walla that summer and I was
								still living in Vancouver with my parents. That meant our second
								date wasn't until a couple weeks later, when he came to my house
								to visit. Looking back, I'm a little impressed that our
								relationship survived the weekend. There were just a few
								stressors we had to deal with: He was "re-meeting" my parents in
								the context of being my boyfriend (which I'm pretty sure is
								always a little nerve-wracking), we went on a hard hike up
								Silver Star Mountain (I'm a little embarrassed to say I was
								probably a little whiny at some points so I'm glad he could put
								up with me), and HE ALMOST GOT US STUCK ON THE WAY DOWN IN A
								HUGE MUD PUDDLE (this one needs no explanation).
							</p>
							<p align="left">
								We could finally be a normal couple once I went to school that
								fall, though we had to get really creative with our dates given
								the COVID restrictions that were still in place. We went on lots
								of drives, had lots of movie nights at his apartment, and
								discovered how much we loved star-gazing together. I was really
								thankful to have him around since I wasn't allowed to have a
								roommate that first quarter, and social events didn't exist. I
								would have gone absolutely bonkers without someone I could talk
								to face-to-face without a mask. We even got to take fall quarter
								Western Thought together in a weird twist of fate!
							</p>
							<p align="left">
								Our fun together (at least in person) continued through my
								sophomore year, until Edson decided to interview with Boeing on
								a whim. He wasn't expecting to get a job offer, but when he did,
								I knew that if I told him he shouldn't go because I wanted him
								to stay I'd be holding him back, it might have been more
								detrimental to our relationship than if he had gone. So, he
								accepted the job, and we went to look for apartments over
								Memorial Weekend of 2022. After looking at apartments we planned
								to stay Sunday night in the parking lot at Beckler Peak, hike
								the trail early the next morning, then book it back to Walla
								Walla so I could be ready to go back to class on Tuesday.
								Mostly, that plan went without a hitch. We found Edson an
								apartment and a roommate, explored Leavenworth on Sunday, made
								it to the trailhead, and got a good night's rest. Our hike up
								Beckler Peak was when it got a little rough: two miles into the
								four mile one-way trip we encountered an unexpected field of
								snow, which we were able to navigate mostly successfully with
								the GPS on my phone and our strap-on shoe spikes, but then my
								phone was too close to dying for comfort, so we decided to turn
								around. Right around then, though, we saw a guy trail-blazing
								straight up the side of the mountain (instead of attempting to
								follow the switch-backs like we were), so we asked if we could
								follow him, which he graciously allowed. Somehow, we made it to
								the top, so Edson and I were able to stop shortly into our trek
								down for the picture that Edson had said he wanted to get. He
								made the mistake, however, of not telling our guide-friend that
								we were stopping, so I was anxiously poking at the snow with my
								poles and telling him to hurry up. I had turned around to
								distract myself with looking at the snow on the trees, and when
								I turned back around, Edson was down on one knee, asking me if I
								would marry him. My immediate response was, "Are you kidding??"
								In my defense, we had explicitly discussed that I didn't want to
								get married until after I graduated, and he didn't want an
								engagement longer than nine months, so I was not at ALL
								expecting it. Obviously, once the shock wore off a litte I was
								able to yes, and it felt like I was floating the four miles down
								the mountain. Our day was far from over though: we knew Edson's
								fog-lights had somehow stayed on too long, draining his car
								battery, but we both had brought extra battery packs so we
								weren't worried when we got down to the parking lot. We did
								start to get worried, though, when the car battery just wouldn't
								charge, giving us a pretty good hint that his alternator was
								out. Thanks to a fellow hiker, we were able to get just enough
								juice to get out of the parking lot and start coasting down the
								windy road to the main road. Unfortunately, we rolled to a stop
								about a mile from the main road, and quickly discovered that
								since it was a holiday, there wasn't going to be many tow trucks
								to come get us, and AAA wouldn't tow us until we were on actual
								pavement. It wasn't until after lots of phone calls, two tow
								truck rides, too many hours, and the wonderful kindness of the
								Boggess family that we were able to crash into bed.
							</p>
							<p align="left">
								Then comes a very extended, long distance engagement (which I
								wouldn't recommend for wedding planning), so I am
								understandably, REALLY excited for our wedding!!!

								You're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation. It
								all started when I went to the Walla Walla University (WWU)
								cafeteria for the first time my senior year. I was there to meet
								a professor about an internship opportunity he knew about. There
								I was attempting to get the details as others came and went,
								interrupting him to say hello. Finally getting his undivided
								attention we spoke, only for me to receive a tap on the shoulder
								from behind. Turning around, I looked up to see a familiar face,
								which I had last seen nearly a decade ago and 2000+ miles away. A face who I
								would one day call my father-in-law (Chad Carlton for those
								wondering). Taking pause with my professor to speak to the
								Carlton's (Sher being by his side), I soon learned they were
								chaperoning their eldest daughter...Now, two things first: A)
								Due to our 3.5 year age gap (I her senior) & her family moving
								out of Texas when Madi was 12, there never was ANY hint of
								romantic chemistry when we last knew each other. B) Note her age
								when I last saw her and that her parents are nearly an entire
								subway sandwich in height difference and you will easily
								understand the following surprises...When Chad/Sher mentioned
								they were joining Madi, I asked if she was at the cafeteria with
								them and in unison they both stepped to the side creating a
								opening for me to see Madi standing behind them...only I didn't
								see her at first. There was no one at the height of her parents,
								so looking down, lower and lower until below my own head level I
								saw Madi, who now captured my attention in ways I would have
								never anticipated those years ago. Madi reached out to me later
								and we began to catch up. In short time, Madi and I spoke
								endlessly night after night, and during the day as the days
								allowed.
							</p>
							<h4 align="left">Fall 2020 - Winter 2022</h4>
							<p align="left">
								At the start of our first date to the Windmills I met her
								grandparents, and after our second (a hike through fields of
								flowers), I joined Madi and her family for supper. Several
								months later, Madi came to WWU to start college, and our
								relationship continued to grow. So much so that I had intentions
								of staying in the Walla Walla Valley long enough for her to
								graduate and us to wed. That worked well enough until a larger
								opportunity presented itself to me in the form of two
								recruiter's from Boeing. Long story short, it was an opportunity
								too big to pass up. Unfortunately, this meant my plans to stay in
								Walla Walla would have to come to an end.
							</p>
							<h4 align="left">Spring 2022</h4>
							<p align="left">
								There were many ideas I had for my proposal to Madi. One
								important feature was I wanted to propose AWAY from Walla Walla.
								Somewhere unique to us and with an ideal backdrop for awesome
								pictures. Having planned my proposal for the coming months, I
								realized the perfect excuse to go to the Seattle area was for me
								to find my new apartment. After meeting my new roommate & seeing
								several options, Madi and I visited Leavenworth, then backtracked
								to Skykomish to prepare for the big hike the next day [Memorial
								Day, remember...this will be important]. In the morning we began
								our ascent. Unfortunately, the weather proved less than ideal as
								the sky was grey and the clouds descended covering our views.
								Nearly turning back, we were met by a stranger who helped us get
								to the top. I had previously prompted Madi for us to take
								pictures at the top. As our guide began his descent, I pulled
								Madi back for us to get our "pictures." Trying to get the camera
								set up and hide the ring box from her proved...difficult. I was
								successful in surprising her. Guess what her first response was,
								"Are you kidding!?"...lol. We kissed (she did eventually say
								yes) and made our way down to the car. That day also
								proved...difficult, given that my 4Runner, who had otherwise
								proven itself reliable decided it no longer wanted a working
								alternator. When you're miles up a forest road at a trailhead,
								one might want a working vehicle. We did eventually make it
								almost to the main road, but after MANY attempts to get help
								through various means (don't forget it is MEMORIAL DAY), we
								ended up paying the HEFTY fee to get towed 1 mile back so that
								AAA could tow us the rest of the 200+ miles. We finally made it
								where we needed and got to bed past 1 am. Needless to say, I did
								not make it back to work on time the day after Memorial Day.
							</p>

								This finally brings us to today, excited to say forever "I do".
