							<h5 id="CeremonyReception">Ceremony & Reception Location?</h5>
							<p align="left">
								Everything will be happening outdoors at the same location
								(Pomeroy Farm). The reception will take place under a covered
								pavilion (if it rains, the ceremony will be held there too), but
								do come prepared with sunscreen for a warm summer day!
							</p>

							<h5 id="Accomodations">Will the Wedding be Outdoors?</h5>
							<p align="left">
								Provided weather is cooperative, the wedding ceremony will be
								outdoors in an open field.
							</p>

							<h5 id="Accomodations">Expected Weather?</h5>
							<p align="left">
								There is always a chance of rain in the area, although sun is
								generally expected during the month of July. Expect highs in the
								low 80's and lows in the high 50's with few clouds.
							</p>

							<h5 id="DresCode">Dress Code?</h5>
							<p align="left">
								Think garden party style with a bit of western wear thrown in,
								though feel free to lean towards whatever side of that spectrum
								you feel most comfortable with. Oh, and lots of color is highly
								encouraged! However, please do not wear white, and if you don't
								want to match with the wedding party, avoiding blue dresses and
								grey suits is probably wise. There will be lots of grass to
								traverse, so plan accordingly!
							</p>
							<h5 id="Accomodations">Children?</h5>
							<p align="left">
								Children are welcome and accounted for in the invitation.
							</p>

							<h5 id="Accomodations">Accomodations?</h5>
							<p align="left">
								If you're looking for a hotel, the closest one is the Best
								Western Plus Inn & Suites in Battle Ground. Going any farther
								than that puts you at about a 20 to 30 minute drive to the
								venue. Airbnb has lots of good options within a 15 minute drive
								of the venue. That is probably your best bet if you don't want
								to stay in a hotel. If you'd prefer to camp, Battle Ground State
								Park has lots of options from primitive sites to RV hook-ups and
								cabins.
							</p>

							<h5 id="Accomodations">Things To Do Nearby?</h5>
							<p align="left">
								If you're into hiking, there are a lot of good options nearby:
								Moulton Falls, the Battle Ground Loop Trail, Lucia Falls, and
								lots of others. You'll also have your pick of churches if you
								get to town in time: Meadow Glade SDA Church, Adventist
								Community Church in Vancouver, and Whipple Creek SDA Church,
								just to name a few.
							</p>

							<h5 id="Dietary Restrictions">Dietary Restrictions?</h5>
							<p align="left">
								Snacks will be provided during the cocktail hour, followed by a
								full dinner during the reception. Please note any dietary
								restrictions on your invitation. We have made efforts to provide
								options that are suitable for many diets.
							</p>

							<h5 id="Accomodations">Plus Ones?</h5>
							<p align="left">
								Your invitation will specifically state whether we factored a
								plus 1. Due to venue size limitations, we do not have the space
								for unaccounted individuals attending.
							</p>

							<h5 id="Accomodations">RSVP Deadline?</h5>
							<p align="left">
								The last acceptable date to make RSVP changes is June 21st.
								Exceptions will not be made.
							</p>

							<h5 id="Accomodations">Arrival Time?</h5>
							<p align="left">
								Plan to arrive 15-20 minutes before the ceremony. If you arrive
								too early, expect to be drafted to help set-up!
							</p>

							<h5 id="Accomodations">Parking?</h5>
							<p align="left">Pomeroy Farm has plenty of parking available.</p>

							<h5 id="Timeline">Approximate Wedding Day Timeline?</h5>
							<p align="left">
								The ceremony will begin at 4:00 pm, followed by a cocktail hour
								then the reception, with send-off around 8:45/9:00 pm.
							</p>

							<h5 id="Accomodations">Should I bring gifts?</h5>
							<p align="left">
								As noted on our registry, we have no expectations for gifts, but
								have planned for a dedicated locations for gifts for your
								convenience.
							</p>

							<h5 id="Accomodations">Will There be a Open Bar?</h5>
							<p align="left">
								Non-alcoholic drinks will be available. No alcohol will be
								allowed on-site.
							</p>

							<h5 id="Accomodations">
								Can We Take Photos During the Ceremony?
							</h5>
							<p align="left">
								We are honored that you want to capture this moment with us, and
								there will be a dedicated time to take the photos you wish. We
								do however ask that you put away your cameras and phones during
								the wedding ceremony. Our photographer has that under control.
							</p>
							<h5 id="Accomodations">Is it Okay to Post on Social Media?</h5>
							<p align="left">
								Please DO! Tag either one of us or use #GoinCarbajal. We are
								thrilled to see your perspective!
							</p>

							<h5 id="Accomodations">Virtual Attendance Options?</h5>
							<p align="left">
								Unfortunately, due to the nature of the farm, there will not be
								any live-streaming capabilities.
							</p>

							<h5 id="Accomodations">I Have Additional Questions...</h5>
							<p align="left">
								Please reach out to us at weddingcarbajals@gmail.com if you have
								any further questions.
